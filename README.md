# Study Spaces

During the pandemic, it was not very possible to go out in public to study. As someone who loves background ambiance, I created this website that helps stimulate a specific environment as if you were actually there! This studying tool comes with a timer and to-do list manager as well, to have all your studying resources in one place.
